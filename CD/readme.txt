------------------------------------------------

The GBA SDK is located in the /install folder. It must be copied to the local disk to compile the project.

The source for ProjSS is located in the /source folder. The directories in the workspace will have to
be changed depending on where the files are copied to.

The /doc folder contains all documentation and work done from PPR->Final.
